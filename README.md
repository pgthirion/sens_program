# Instructions:
#
# This program allows you to search for stock news data from the ShareData website by entering a stock symbol.
# It fetches the news for the stock symbol, displays the results in a Tkinter GUI, and allows exporting to PDF.
# To use this program, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
#
# Installation Commands for Terminal (Linux/macOS/Windows):
# 1. Install Playwright and download the browsers:
#    pip install playwright
#    playwright install
#
# 2. Install tkinter (if not already installed with Python):
#    pip install tk
#
# 3. Install ReportLab for PDF export:
#    pip install reportlab
#
# 4. Install Requests:
#    pip install requests
#
# Once the libraries are installed, you can run the program, and it will allow you to interact with the interface and fetch stock data.
